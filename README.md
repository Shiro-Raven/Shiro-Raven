## Hello, Stranger. I am Shiro Raven :white_flower:

I am an MSc. Informatics student at TU Munich :computer::de: I worked previously as an R&D ML engineer, dealing with the fields of Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, and Combinatorial Optimization. I also did some research in the area of Automated Software Measurement.  

### What I'm Doing Now
Apart from my studies, I am exploring the field of Quantum Computing, learning different concepts, and implementing some circuits that I use as subroutines frequently. I am currently a mentee at [QOSF](https://qosf.org/)'s mentorship program, working on Distributed Quantum Algorithms.

I plan on keeping everything quantum-related in [this repo](https://github.com/Shiro-Raven/ShiroQ).
